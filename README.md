# Stream-Deck-Profile-Library
Library for profiles made for the various Stream Deck variants.

## Sharing is caring
This library is intended to function as a repository for all kinds of different stream deck profiles.

## How to add to this library?
In order to add to this library please follow the same folder structure that is already made, Make a folder on your PC with the name of the program/game you have a profile for and copy it to that. You can include a version number in the name if you end up updating the profile later down the line.

Once you are happy you send a pull request with the profiles to this library and i will merge them as long as the folder strucutre is good.
